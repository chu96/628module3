## Summary
There are four folders providing details in our main project, *data*, *code*, *image*, *executive summary*.

## Data
*ice_final3.csv* is the data set with business information for target ice-cream shops after cleaning data.

*review.csv* is the data set of review information for target ice-cream shops after data cleaning.

*userweight.csv* is the data set displaying userid and the corresponding contribution to YELP based on user information.


## Code
There are 4 Python code files and 4 R code files:
*load_data.ipynb contains read json files to csv files.

*business_1.ipynb contains data pre-processing of business information.

*review_cleaning.ipynb contains data pre-processeing of review information.

*UserWeight.ipynb contains converting user information to user weight which is more easily to be used.

*ice.R contains final model to predict ranking stars.

*shiny.R contains UI and SERVER part for shiny app used to predict body fat proportion based on user input.

## Image
This folder contains figures produced in our analysis.


## Executive summary
*Executive_summary.ipynb* is a detailed summary of what we did presented in a Jupyter Notebook.
