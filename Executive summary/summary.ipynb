We have 45k reviews in total for our analysis. There are 3 goals we would like to achieve for the project, which are:\n",

For example, information about WiFi is provided by 426 business while information about smoking is only provided by 4 business. This introduces missing values in every attribute. We deal with it by the following 3 methodds:"

    "- Drop the variable. If less than 100 business provide status of this attribute, we delete this attribute since missing value of this variable contributes too much to be handled.\n",
    "- Randomly replce missing value with non-missing value. We do t-test for each attribute to test if the mean stars of business that tell information about this attribute differs from that of business don't tell. If there is no difference, it is reasonable to consider that this variable's missing value are missing at random regardless of stars. That is to say unobserved true value of this attribute shares the same distribution of observed value. Thus, we replace missing values with values that are sampling from distribution of non-missing values. Take 'Bikeparking' as an example. There are 91 FALSE, 343 TRUE and 19 NA. We assign FALSE and TRUE to NA randomly and proportionally, that is assigning 4 FALSE and 15 TRUE to replace NA.\n",
    "- Impute missing value by KNN. If there is significant difference between stars of business that provide a given attribute's information or not, we can conclude that missing values are not missing at random. Thus we use KNN model to predict the true value of missing value based on stars and review counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there is no missing value in selected attributes. However, some attributes have multiple categories. We attempt to reduce categories for the convinence of later analysis. F-test shows significant difference exists among multiple groups. Then we perfom Tukey test to test difference between pairwise groups. If the difference is not significant, we combine the two categories into one.<br />\n",
    "b. For 'hours', we reduce 7 days to 2 groups: weekday and weekend. If the shop is close, then there is missing value for open time and close time of this day. There are only 4 business close on weekdays so we ignore it. For each business, we compute weekday open time by mode of open time from Monday to Friday. Weekday close time is likewise. There are 22 business close on weekends, so we add a varibale to show business opening time. If it closes on weekend, then the opening time is 0. Otherwise it is calculated by counting hours from open time and close time. For each business, we compute weekend open time by mean of open time on Saturday and Sunday. Weekend close time is likewise. Too many different time points lead to complicated analysis, so we find the best cut points for open time, close time and opening time by a proposed algorithm[1]. Since cut points of open time for both weekdays and weekends are insignificant, we drop this two variables. Optimal cut points of close time for both weekdays and weekends are 23:00 and for business time is 11 hours. Hence, these three variables can be converted to two-categorical variables."

Consequently, we construct a logistic regression model to predict the validity of a customer. \n",

We use users' weight to compute the weighted star ratings of business. For a given business, we take the average weighted stars in corresponding reviews. <br />\n",

    "Since linear regression is the most interpretable and easiest model, we start with building mutivariate linear regression model between stars and various attributes. We use 5-fold cross validation. When testing the model, we first predict the stars by model in validation dataset. Then we round both the predicted result and the observed stars to integer and count how many samples have the same predicted and observed value. The main reason to do this is that we prefer to provide integer stars to businees rather than float. The mean 'misclssification rate' is 31%. <br />\n",

    "* Overall:<br />\n",
    "(1) It is unnecessary to have caterings nor TVs.<br />\n",
    "(2) The shops shouldn't be too noisy, thus noisy group activities should not be allowed.<br />\n",
    "(3) Basic service such as reservation, wheelchair, take out, delivery, credit card acception are expected to provide.<br />\n",
    "(4) It is better to close after 11:00 pm at weekend while it is not necessary to do so at weekdays.<br />\n",
    "(5) Provide different sizes of ice-cream. Fresh and delicious are vital.<br />\n",
    "* Specified for city:<br />\n",
    "Charlotte:<br />\n",
    "(1) Flavor: The business owners should emphasize on the flavor of chocolate and strawberry,  making the ice cream creamy, and being innovative in developing new ice cream accompanied by cookies and waffle.<br />\n",
    "(2) Service: The business owners should know the location and long waiting time for waiting are the major concerns for ice cream business, so the new ice cream store should address such problems. Also the atitude of employee are crucial for having good comments.<br />\n",
    "Cleveland:<br />\n",
    "(1) Flavor: The business owners should  pay much attention to the flavor of chocolate and caramel, and also make ice cream creamy.<br />\n",
    "(2) Service: Price, waiting time and service atitude are the major concerns for ice cream business, so  new ice cream stores should address such problems by providing higher quality service, and also launching more affordable items.<br />\n",
    "Madison:<br />\n",
    "(1) Flavor: The business owners need to notice that the flavor of chocolate and custard are most popular, and peanut  catches lots of attention too. They also need to make the ice cream creamy enough to earn high ratings.<br />\n",
    "(2) Service: Location and price are two most apparent problems. They should launch some new items with cheaper price, and it's also worth trying to open new stores in good locations.<br />\n",
    "Phoenix:<br />\n",
    "(1) Flavor: Choclate flavor is recommended. Also, try to develop new ice cream accompanied by cookies.<br />\n",
    "(2) Service: The ice cream business in Phoenix has much potential for improvement and actually lots of customers are not satisfied with the service. Therefore, business owners can  open new stores in center locations and offer high-quality service to attract more potential customers.<br />\n",
    "Pittsburgh: <br />\n",

    "(4) Spatial anaysis would distinguish ice cream preference in different regions, and offer more specific suggestions.  \n",
    "Cons:<br />\n",
    "(1) We are not able to quantify the effect of each word or feature to the rate of review.<br />\n",
